# Documentation Guidelines

> ðŸ’¡ To improve the quality of our component documentation we are currently in the process of updating our storybook to use Storyboook's [controls](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-controls/), [a11y](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-a11y/) and [docs](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-docs/) plugins. You will find most components currently without documentation and use [knobs](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-knobs)(deprecated) for their primary interactivity. These will eventually be updated. Want to contribute?

## General Guidelines

Thorough documentation makes it much easier for a component to be found, adapted and reused. It also provides space for explanation and reasoning for a component. This is useful as components become more complex.

## Why Stories Are Important

Stories are incredibly valuable for component development and provide multiple benefits:

- **Isolated Development**: Stories allow you to work on and make changes to components in complete isolation, without needing to navigate through the entire application to reach the component's usage
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Stories help catch visual regressions when making system-wide changes by providing a centralized place to view all component variations
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Stories enable non-engineering team members like designers and product managers to easily view and interact with components without needing to run the full application
- **Better PR Workflow**: Stories support breaking up large PRs by allowing you to commit UI components first, then stitch them together with logic later, keeping PRs smaller and easier to review
- **Component Discovery**: Stories serve as a living component library, making it easier for developers to discover and understand existing components before creating new ones

Some general documentation best practices to follow:

- Put yourself in the shoes of another developer trying to use the component you just created for the first time


## Creating a Story

[Component Story Format (CSF)](https://storybook.js.org/docs/configure#configure-story-loading) is the recommended way to write stories. It's an open standard based on ES6 modules.

A story **without MDX** documentation can be as simple as:

```tsx
import type { Meta } from '@storybook/your-framework';

import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

const meta = {
   title: 'Components/UI/MyComponent', // title should follow the folder structure location of the component. Don't use
  component: MyComponent,
} satisfies Meta<typeof MyComponent>;

export default meta;
```
