# Documentation Guidelines

> ðŸ’¡ We are standardizing on Storybook CSF 3 and preparing for Storybook v9. Prefer controls, a11y, autodocs, and typed stories.

## General Guidelines

Thorough documentation makes components easier to find, adapt, and reuse. Keep examples simple, deterministic, and accessible.

- Think like a first-time user of the component
- Add a brief description in the component's `README.md`
- Display the component API via Args/Controls; add descriptions via JSDoc in TypeScript types or PropTypes
- Use Controls (not knobs)
- Use the action argType annotation for events

## Stories (CSF 3)

- Use CSF 3 with typed `Meta` and `StoryObj`
- Title should mirror folder structure; avoid spaces
- Prefer `args` for variations instead of ad-hoc state
- Use a `render` function only when composition or handlers are needed; keep it minimal
- Keep stories deterministic; mock time, randomness, and network

## ArgTypes and Controls

- Expose interactive props via `argTypes` and set sensible defaults with `args`
- Use select controls for enums; boolean for flags; text for strings
- Log events using `onX` action annotations (e.g., `onClick: { action: 'clicked' }`)

## Additional Best Practices

- Keep global decorators minimal; prefer per-story decorators
- Prefer autodocs; avoid custom MDX pages for UI components
- Ensure accessible usage; include labels and roles in examples
