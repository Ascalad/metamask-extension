# Viem Utilities

This directory contains code that was copied from the [viem](https://github.com/wevm/viem) repository, in order to avoid bloating the extension with the whole package.
This code is needed by the Delegation Toolkit logic, which was also copied over until we com up with a better solution, together with the Delegation Team.
