# MetaMask Ditto POC - Executive Summary

## Overview

This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the technical feasibility and business value of integrating Ditto content management with MetaMask's browser extension localization system. The POC addresses the current challenges in managing 56 languages and ~7,000 strings across MetaMask's ecosystem.

## Current State Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Manual File Management**: 56 locale folders with individual JSON files
- **Build System Complexity**: Static file copying without validation
- **No Type Safety**: Runtime errors for missing or incorrect strings
- **Inconsistent Processes**: Ad-hoc translation workflows

### Process Challenges
- **Translation Bottlenecks**: Manual GitHub PR-based workflow
- **Context Loss**: Translators lack visual context and mockups
- **Quality Issues**: Inconsistent translations and missing strings
- **Maintenance Overhead**: High manual effort for string updates

### Community Challenges
- **Contributor Friction**: Complex contribution process
- **Coordination Difficulty**: Manual review and approval workflows
- **Limited Tooling**: Basic text editors without translation context

## Proposed Solution: Ditto Integration
