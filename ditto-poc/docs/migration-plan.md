# MetaMask Ditto Migration Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive migration strategy for transitioning MetaMask's localization system from manual JSON management to Ditto content management.

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Migrate MetaMask's 56-language localization system to Ditto for improved translation workflow, better collaboration, and automated content management.

**Timeline**: 12-16 weeks total
- **Phase 1**: Setup & Pilot (4 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Core Integration (4 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Full Migration (4 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Optimization (4 weeks)

**Resources Required**:
- 1 Senior Developer (full-time)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (50% time)
- 1 Product Manager (25% time)
- 3-5 Community Translators (pilot)

## Current State Analysis

### Existing System
- **Languages**: 56 locales in `app/_locales/`
- **Format**: Chrome extension i18n JSON
- **Strings**: ~7,000 unique strings
- **Workflow**: Manual GitHub PR-based translation
- **Maintenance**: High manual overhead

### Pain Points
1. **Manual Process**: Copy-paste between documents and code
2. **Context Loss**: Translators lack visual context
3. **Coordination Overhead**: Manual reviewer workload
4. **Quality Issues**: Inconsistent translations
5. **Slow Updates**: Release-dependent string changes

## Migration Strategy

### Approach: Phased Migration
We'll use a gradual, low-risk approach that maintains backward compatibility throughout the transition.

### Risk Mitigation
- **Fallback Systems**: Local files as backup
- **Parallel Operation**: Both systems running during transition
- **Rollback Plan**: Quick reversion if issues arise
- **Testing**: Extensive validation at each phase
