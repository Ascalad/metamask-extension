/**
 * DEV NOTES:
 *
 * I think we can replace the underlying PollingController with a new SubscriptionController.
 * It can keep a similar interface:
 * - startPolling becomes startSocket or startSubscription
 * - endPolling becomes closeSocket or closeSubscription
 * This controller will need to handle duplicate subscriptions, and correctly manage subscriptions.
 * - We may need a "keep alive" heartbeat if Infura closes "stale" connections on their end.
 *
 * TokenBalancePollingController becomes TokenBalanceSubscriptionController
 * - On Message Receive - it updates the token state.
 *
 * UI:
 * - Replace dispatch calls for polling with subscriptions
 * - And it works(TM), as state is automatically updated through the socket messages
 *
 * -----
 *
 * Concerns:
 * - We probably need to better handle these sockets, as currently it is only per address per token per chain
 * - An address could have hundreds of tokens on a chain (+ multichain portfolio view shows tokens on all chains)
 *   - This currently would be HUNDREDS of sockets
 *   > In the Chromium source code (Google Chrome for Linux) I can see a max of 30 per host, 256 overall
 *
 * Maybe we can use RabbitMQ (AMPQ), where our server dumps data to topics, and the client listens to topics it currently cares about?
 * - (It's been a while since I used it, but isn't this 1 connection but multiple channels?)
